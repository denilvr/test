      <p style="font-size:17px;">Founded in 2011, only 3 years after the college was established IIST MUN is one of the most prestigious conference of its kind in South India. Staffed entirely by IIST undergraduates, IIST MUN gathers participants from various parts of India, especially South India, to simulate the activities of the United Nations. IIST MUN offers a unique opportunity to experience the challenges of international negotiation and diplomacy.</p>
<p style="font-size:17px;">This year, the conference will take this tradition to a new level with numerous innovations designed to enhance the delegate experience. This session will be held in IIST, Trivandrum on April 7th and 8th, 2018 . Throughout the conference, delegates will gain insight into the workings of the United Nations by actively participating in the resolution of important global issues. Participants will not only work with many other motivated college students with the common goals of furthering international awareness and building consensus, but will also work within a lively social setting.</p>
<p style="font-size:17px;">The Secretariat cordially invites you to join us for the 8th session of Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology Model United Nations.</p>

        <div class="modal-body" style="font-size:20px; padding:20px;">
          <p>True to the mission of the United Nations as declared in its 1945 charter, IISTMUN serves as a forum in which students from colleges and universities around India can meet to discuss the greatest challenges facing the world today, in fields ranging from international peace and security to economic and social progress and human rights. In this spirit, the goal of IIST MUN is to begin a process whereby constructive debate today can lead to solutions tomorrow. IIST MUN strives to ensure that the committees we offer provide an educational and comprehensive look at a diverse range of pressing issues. Our directors work throughout the conference to make debate as realistic as possible, so that our delegates get a sense of the complexities of real-world international negotiation, and, as with the real United Nations, place an unequalled emphasis on cooperation and compromise rather than on the supremacy of any one country’s position. In this way, delegates get a chance not only to learn about current international affairs and to discover and represent one country’s position, but also how to stick to that position while working with many other delegates.</p> <br>
          <b>Substantive Excellence</b> <br>
Our staff works tirelessly to write the most well-informed, up-to-date, comprehensive study guides and research materials possible. We make it our responsibility to ensure that each delegate is given a solid foundation of knowledge before the conference so that he or she will have a rewarding intellectual experience in committee. We place a high premium on professionalism and preparedness, and all of our directors are dedicated to exceeding these expectations. <br>
<b>Tradition and Innovation</b> <br>
Being the first space science college in Asia IIST MUN is the product of years of gradual refinement. Each year not only are the general topics discussed but also the space related topics are inculcated to make the MUN more interesting and gather many science enthusiasts too. IIST MUN is thus founded upon a solid tradition but never ceases to innovate, and the 2018 conference will be no exception. <br>

<b>Fun!</b> <br>
The staff of IIST MUN is also dedicated to making the city accessible to all delegates and faculty advisors throughout the weekend. We are sure you’ll have a wonderful time exploring the city.

        <p> <b> Topic A: The Arab-Israeli Conflict: A Regional Analysis of Arab-Israeli Relations</b> <br>
Dating back to the early 20th century, Israel and surrounding Arab nations – including Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Palestine – have always had strained relations. With the rise of Zionism and the British Mandate over Palestine and Transjordan during World War I, the many territorial disputes with both Palestinians and surrounding Arab nations began their onset. These disputes were not solely restricted to the territorial aspects, but stemmed from mutual antagonism between both peoples. As tensions continued to grow with the incite of mass protests, violence, and illegal immigration, conflict eventually brewed into war. Beginning with the Arab-Israeli War of 1948, each subsequent decade saw some war with a neighbouring Middle Eastern country and Israel. These wars often resulted in hostilities from both sides, and unresolved tensions that still exist today. For these reasons, and many more, the discussion on Israel in regards to the Arab World cannot be limited to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict alone.
As we move towards more contemporary analyses of the regional conflicts, we must look towards current progress by the international community. With the Security Council’s passing of the historic S/RES/2334, condemning Israeli settlements, and the following announcement by Israel to begin constructing new settlements in Palestine for the first time in 20 years, we must look towards solutions that can be enforced and ensure that the rights of both peoples are considered – and that these rights are built on an agenda to restore and preserve the security of the Mediterranean region. How can the international community intervene to resolve the conflict and have their resolution accepted by both groups? How do we respond to the hostilities? Is there further action that should be taken? These questions and many more must be considered as you work to find a resolution in a time of heightened tension and despair in the region.</p>
<p>
<b>Topic B: North Korea: Evaluating Human Rights and the Threat of Nuclear War</b><br>
For many decades, North Korea has had tense relations with South Korea and other members of the international community. These tensions stem from border skirmishes, assassination attempts, and alignment with different powers during the Korean War and the following Cold War. As the Cold War came to a close, anti-North Korean and anti-communism sentiment ran heavy throughout South Korea, damaging the potential for reunification early on. Furthermore, as China started to work towards restoring relations with the West, North Korea began fervently attempting to maintain its independence in the eyes of the global community. As we move towards more modern issues, we see two that immediately call the attention of the international community: North Korea’s growing nuclear power, and its human rights abuses that run rampantly throughout the nation. Additionally, these two issues create major concerns for the regional stability of the Asian region, demanding action by the global community.
North Korean nationalism is at the root of many of these pressing problems. With a government that restricts freedom of expression and movement, association, and many other political and economic freedoms, North Korea’s citizens face a heavy threat of execution and brutal treatment. Moreover, the expansion of their nuclear program, and threats upon nuclear warfare in South Korea, the United States, and other members of the international community demands immediate action. As we look towards building a resolution, we must consider the consequences faced by many regional partners, including South Korea, China, Japan, and many others, in order to build a solution that protects both the region and the global community as a whole.

<b>AGENDA : Formulation of a New Outer Space Usage and Colonization Treaty to give a legal framework to the usage of outer space for energy resources and colonization.</b>
<br> <br>
<b>Usage of Outer Space for Energy Resources</b> <br>
<p>
There are two primary methods for incorporating spaceborne technologies into the push for more, and more efficient, implementation of renewable energy into the international energy economy. Already, many entities use satellite-based monitoring systems to assist in more thorough mapping of various factors relevant to energy production. These factors can be as basic as measurement of average sunlight and weather patterns, or as precise as measuring minute shifts in structures and land masses. The more promising - but also much more complex - method, which can likely be operationalized in the very near future, involves using space-based production of energy, and then using various methods to transmit that power to Earth-based receptors. Satellite-based monitoring is capable of providing a wealth of data on various factors that affect the efficiency of solar, wind, and hydroelectric power generation. Key to these efforts is the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS), which the then-G7 created in 1984. CEOS helps to coordinate earth observation efforts across the international community, focusing on harmonizing data and measurement standards across different space programs. CEOS also helped create the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), a clearinghouse for both technical standards and raw data, that functions in partnership with national agencies and space programs. These tools are invaluable for the management and placement of terrestrial renewable energy platforms. For example, NASA and ESA data shared via GEOSS can be used to map average solar radiation amounts in different areas, thus helping to maximize solar panel efficiency. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has also been utilized as a powerful tool for monitoring the integrity of, and locating proper sites for, renewable energy platforms; spaceborne SAR systems can detect minute shifts or movements in both terrain and structures, which is especially useful for isolated or remote installations. These data can also be used to generate energy yield forecasts for various areas, assisting in overall electrical grid planning. Hydroelectric and wave power generation efforts are also assisted by satellite monitoring. Precipitation, wind and wave patterns, snow cover and runoff data - all of these are key to placement, efficiency and maintenance of hydroelectric and wave power, and spaceborne SAR monitoring as well as other forms of satellite imagery provide crucial data sets to assist in these efforts. Spaceborne technologies are not limited merely to monitoring in terms of relevance to renewable energy, however. Several States already have projects in the planning stages to harness the unique properties of low earth orbit for generating power in space. Without atmospheric interference, and without being limited by a terrestrial day-night cycle, solar panels placed in orbit are massively more efficient than those placed on the ground. Space programs as far back as the 1970s, therefore, have studied the potential for placing massive solar panel arrays in orbit, and using LASER or microwave-based transmission to send the majority of that power back down to earth. While atmospheric interference for the former technique, and dissipation over distance for the latter technique, mean that there is some efficiency loss in theory, space-based solar platforms would still provide much more power than terrestrial solar farms would. Additionally, since the only necessary infrastructure on the ground would be a LASER or microwave receiver, rather than an entire solar farm, in theory space-based solar is especially ideal for providing renewable energy to remote regions with little local infrastructure, or for providing emergency power generation in disaster response scenarios. Both governmental and nongovernmental entities now have projects aimed at launching and building such platforms, with one firm, Solaren, targeting the end of the decade to have its pilot program in orbit and generating power. With the deployment of these technologies being imminent, then, it is necessary to consider how they interact with existing international law relating to space.</p>

<b>Space Colonization</b>
<br>
One of the major environmental concerns of our time is the increasing consumption of Earth's resources to sustain our way of life. As more and more nations make the climb up from agricultural to industrial nations, their standard of life will improve; which will mean that more and more people will be competing for the same resources. While NASA spin offs and other inventions can allow us to be more thrifty with Earth's resources, we nevertheless must come to grips with the problem that humanity is currently limited to one planet. Space colonies could be the answer to this problem, if we can solve the medical problems posed by microgravity (also called weightlessness) and the high levels of radiation to which the astronauts would be exposed after leaving the protection of the Earth's atmosphere. The colonists would mine the Moon and the minor planets and build beamed power satellites that would supplement or even replace power plants on the Earth. The colonists could also take advantage of the plentiful raw materials, unlimited solar power, vacuum, and microgravity in other ways to create products that we cannot while inside the cocoon of Earth's atmosphere and gravity. In addition to potentially replacing our current Earth-polluting industries, these colonies may also help our environment in other ways. Since the colonists would inhabit completely isolated manmade environments, they would refine our knowledge of the Earth's ecology. This vision, which was purely science fiction for years and years, caught the imagination of the public in the Seventies, leading to the establishment of the organization known today as the National Space Society. <br>

Why Space Settlements?</b> <br>
With our rising planet’s population competing for space and resources, some people are convinced we need to look beyond Earth to help ensure humanity’s survival. As Elon Musk, the entrepreneur behind space tourism company SpaceX put it: “I think there is a strong argument for making life multi-planetary in order to safeguard the existence of humanity in the event that something catastrophic were to happen.” Even if you don’t believe this bleak vision, it’s hard to ignore the eternal human instinct to discover the undiscovered – an urge that could push people beyond the safety of our planet. And there might not be as many hurdles as you might think. “We are at the level of technology where we can imagine leaving the planet for a few nearby places in our Solar System,” former astronaut Jeffrey Hoffman, who will present his ideas at our summit, told BBC Future previously. “The Moon is just around the corner, and Mars isn’t that far away. We have the possibility of at least making the first steps of those voyages in our own lifetimes.”
Resources in space, both in materials and energy, are enormous. The Solar System alone has, according to different estimates, enough material and energy to support anywhere from several thousand to over a billion times that of the current Earth-based human population. Outside the Solar System in the Milky Way, several hundred billion other galaxies in the observable universe provide opportunities for both colonization and resource collection, though travel to any of them is impossible on any practical time-scale without the use of generation ships or revolutionary new methods of travel, such as faster-than-light (FTL) engines. All these planets and other bodies offer a virtually endless supply of resources providing limitless growth potential. Harnessing these resources can lead to much economic development.
